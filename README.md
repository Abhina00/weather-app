## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Login / Register** — demo auth, stored in browser `localStorage`
- 🔎 **City search** — live weather via the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- 🌡️ **Weather details** — temperature, feels-like, humidity, wind, pressure, condition icon
- 🕒 **Search history** — per-user, persisted in `localStorage`, click to re-search, delete/clear individual entries

|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Framework | React 18 (Create React App)      |
| UI        | Material UI (MUI) v5             |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
cd YOUR_REPO
npm install
```

### 2. Add your API key
Get a free key at [openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api) (the "Current Weather Data" plan is enough — free tier gives 1,000 calls/day).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env`:
```env
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
```

> ⚠️ New keys can take **10 minutes to 2 hours** to activate. If you get a `401 Unauthorized`, wait a bit before assuming something's broken.

### 3. Run it
```bash
npm start
```
Opens at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Log in with any username/password (it's demo auth — it creates the account on first use via Register).

## 🧠 How It Works

### Auth
`AuthContext` keeps a `user` object in React state and mirrors it to `localStorage` so a page refresh doesn't log you out. `register()` stores `{ username: { password } }` in `localStorage["weather_app_users"]`; `login()` checks against it.

> **This is demo-only auth** — passwords are stored in plain text in the browser. For production, swap out `AuthContext.jsx` for a real backend (Firebase Auth, Auth0, Supabase, or your own API with hashed passwords + JWT). Every component already talks to `useAuth()` (`login`, `register`, `logout`, `user`), so no other file needs to change.

### Weather data
`services/weatherApi.js` calls `/data/2.5/weather` with `units=metric` and normalizes the response into a flat object (`temp`, `humidity`, `windSpeed`, `description`, `icon`, etc.), so components never touch the raw API shape.

### Search history
Stored per-user under `weather_app_history_<username>`, capped at the 10 most recent, de-duplicated by city name, newest first. Clicking an entry re-runs the search live rather than showing stale cached data.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Backend so accounts/history sync across devices
- [ ] 5-day forecast (`/forecast` endpoint)
- [ ] Geolocation ("use my current location")
- [ ] °C / °F unit toggle
- [ ] Debounced city autocomplete via OpenWeatherMap's Geocoding API
